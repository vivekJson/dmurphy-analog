* Texas Instruments - LP5024/18 RGB LED driver

The LP5024/18 is 24-Channel, I2C RGB LED Drivers that can group RGB LEDs into
a LED group or control them individually.

The main difference between the LP5024 and L5018 is the number of
RGB LEDs they support.  The LP5024 supports twenty four strings while the
LP5018 supports eighteen strings.

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		"ti,lp5018"
		"ti,lp5024"
	- reg :  I2C slave address
	- #address-cells : 1
	- #size-cells : 0

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpios : gpio pin to enable/disable the device.
	- vled-supply : LED supply

Required child properties:
	- reg : Is the child node iteration.
	- led-sources : LP5024 - 0 - 7
			LP5018 - 0 - 5
			Declares the LED string or strings that the child node
			will control.  If ti,control-bank is set then this
			property will contain multiple LED IDs.

Optional child properties:
	- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger :
	   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- ti,control-bank : Indicates that the LED strings declared in the
			    led-sources property are grouped within a control
			    bank for brightness and mixing control.

Example:

led-controller@28 {
	compatible = "ti,lp5024";
	reg = <0x28>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vled-supply = <&vbatt>;

	led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		led-sources = <1>;
	};

	led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		led-sources = <0 6>;
		ti,control-bank;
	};

}
