LP5018/LP5024/LP5030/LP5036 Common Driver
=================================================

Authors: Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>

Description
-----------
The LP50XX RGB LED drivers have the ability to group multiple RGB cluster
LEDs into a single group for simultaneous control or expose single RGB cluster
for control.  This device exposes different register interfaces to control
the cluster brightness as well as the individual RGB LEDs color intensity.

RGB Cluster Color Control
-------------------------
The LP50xx driver will expose a file called "color" for each LED class instance
defined.  This file will accept a 24-bit RGB value in which the the color of the
RGB LEDs will be set.

The 24-bit RGB value passed in follows the pattern 0xXXRRGGBB
XX - Do not care ignored by the driver
RR - is the 8 bit Red LED value
GG - is the 8 bit Green LED value
BB - is the 8 bit Blue LED value

Example:
LED module output 4 of the LP5024 will be a yellow color:
echo 0xe6de00 > /sys/class/leds/lp5024\:led4_mod/color

LED module output 4 of the LP5024 will be dimmed 50%:
echo 0x80 > /sys/class/leds/lp5024\:led4_mod/brightness

LED banked RGBs of the LP5036 will be a white color:
echo 0xffffff > /sys/class/leds/lp5036\:led_banked/color

LED banked RGBs of the LP50364 will be dimmed 50%:
echo 0x80 > /sys/class/leds/lp5036\:led_banked/brightness
